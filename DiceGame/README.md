This is a simple dice game. 

Task:

We have 2 dices, 2 players and we want to see which of the 2 players is the winner. 
You can simulate rolling one die by choosing one of the integers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 at random. 
The number you pick represents the number on the die after it is rolled.
Do this twice and add the results together to get the total roll.
